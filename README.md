# cobweb-psych
Cobweb worked in experiments on multiple psychological effects in human learning.

Each directory under `experiments` contains:
*   `paper` - a directory outlining all relevant papers
*   `results` - a directory with all code and result graphics
Directories have been named to discuss the effect that we are demonstrating within that directory.
